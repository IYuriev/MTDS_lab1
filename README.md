# Quadratic Equation Solver

This project is a quadratic equation solver that can run in either interactive or non-interactive mode.

## Instructions for Running the Project
 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IYuriev/MTDS_lab1.git
   ```
 Install dependencies:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

## Interactive Mode
Run the application:
```bash
node main.js
```

## Interactive Mode
Run the application:
```bash
node main.js file.txt
```

## File Format
The file passed as an argument in non-interactive mode should contain three numbers (a, b, c) separated by spaces, for example:
```bash
1 2 -3
```
This corresponds to the equation:
1xÂ² - 2x - 3 = 0.
